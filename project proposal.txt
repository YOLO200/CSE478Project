CSE 478 Project Proposal Team members: Ashmit Arya Nathan Yee Sarjan Patel Yashvi Jasani Project Idea: Over the past several decades, popular music has undergone dramatic transformations in rhythm, energy, loudness, and emotional tone. This project, “Sonic Evolution: How Music Has Changed Over Time,” explores how the sound of popular music has evolved from the 1960s to today using audio feature data from publicly available Spotify and Million Song datasets. Our story investigates whether songs have become faster, louder, or more energetic, and whether modern music differs in emotional “valence” or danceability compared to earlier decades. Through a series of interactive visualizations, users will be able to explore changes in musical trends over time and across genres—illustrating the evolution of our collective musical taste and production styles. The final product will be an interactive scrollytelling webpage where users scroll through decades of music history, observing trends and relationships among key musical attributes. Datasets: We will use the following publicly available datasets: 1. Spotify Tracks Dataset ● URL: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zaheenhamidani/ultimate-spotify-tracks-db ● Colloquial Description: Contains over 160,000 songs with metadata (artist, genre, release year) and audio features such as energy, danceability, valence, tempo, loudness, and acousticness. ● Abstract Description: Each record can be modeled as ⟨track_name, artist, album, year, genre, popularity, key, mode, time_signature, danceability, energy, valence, loudness, tempo, duration ⟩ ● We will be performing data abstraction on this dataset to limit it to the necessary attributes: ○ track_name (Nominal; string): The title of the song. Example: “C’est beau de faire un Show.” ○ artist_name (Nominal; string): The name of the performer or group. Example: Henri Salvador. ○ genre (Categorical; string): The musical category or style the track belongs to, such as Pop, Rock, or Soundtrack. ○ popularity (Quantitative; integer): A score between 0 and 100 representing how popular the track is on Spotify, derived from play counts and user engagement. ○ danceability (Quantitative; float): A measure (0 to 1) of how suitable a track is for dancing, based on rhythm stability, tempo, and beat strength. ○ energy (Quantitative; float): A measure (0 to 1) of intensity and activity, capturing elements like dynamic range, loudness, and timbre. ○ acousticness (Quantitative, float): Indicates the likelihood that the track is acoustic (0 = electronic, 1 = purely acoustic). 2. Million Song Dataset ● URL: https://corgis-edu.github.io/corgis/csv/music/ ● Colloquial Description: This dataset contains metadata and audio features for 1 million popular tracks, including artist, release year, and song familiarity. Useful for validating broader trends. ● Abstract Description: Each record can be modeled as ⟨title, artist_name, year, duration, tempo, key, mode, time_signature⟩ ● We will be performing data abstraction on this dataset to limit it to the necessary attributes. ○ title (Nominal; string): Name of the track. ○ artist_name (Nominal; string): Name of the performing artist or band. ○ year (Ordered, Quantitative; integer): Year the song was released. ○ duration (Ordered, Quantitative; float): Total length of the song. ○ tempo (Ordered, Quantitative, float): Speed or pace of the track in beats per minute. ○ key (Categorical, int): Musical key (0 = C, 1 = C♯/D♭, ..., 11 = B). ○ mode (Categorical, int): Modality of the song: 0 = minor, 1 = major. ○ time_signature (Ordered, Quantitative, int): Rhythmic structure of the track (e.g., 3, 4, 5). The main dataset for implementation will be the Spotify Tracks Dataset because it is complete, easy to preprocess, and includes all key attributes for visualization. Planned Visualization Techniques: We plan to use D3.js to create a scrollytelling web experience that visually narrates music’s evolution in its structure, emotion, and popularity across time.
